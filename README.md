# Challenge Questions
Here you'll find my homebrew solutions to some challenging questions I've found around the internet.
Each question is solved in a single method in a Java class.  Some classes do have more than one method, but each method is an answer to the same question.  You'll find as well that every answer has a matching Junit test class to verify that the solutions given are correct.

Feel free to use these to learn from, or even to copy from.  I'm sure I'm not the first person to come up with any of these solutions.
